# dayplanner
## Description  
A day planner that can be used universally with a schedule that starts at 9am and ends at 5pm.

In this project I used javascript, bootstrap, jquery and third party apis. Like most programs used HTML to create the bare bones and styled with CSS, javascript and moments for the real time clock.

## Usage
To use the calendar type in your task and hit the save icon on the right.
